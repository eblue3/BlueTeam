                               x86 Architecture
 The x86 architecture has 8 General-Purpose Registers (GPR), 6 Segment Registers, 1 Flags Register and an Instruction Pointer.
 64-bit x86 has additional registers.

********************************************************************************
             General-Purpose Registers (GPR) - 16-bit naming conventions
 The 8 GPRs are:
Data Registers:
   1, *(AX) Accumulator register. Used in arithmetic operations
   2, *(CX) Counter register. Used in shift/rotate instructions and loops.
   3, *(DX) Data register. Used in arithmetic operations and I/O operations.
   4, *(BX) Base register. Used as a pointer to data (located in segment register DS, when in segmented mode).
   5, *(SP) Stack Pointer register. Pointer to the top of the stack.
   6, *(BP) stack Base Pointer register. Used to point to the base of the stack.
Index Registers:
   7, (SI) Source Index register. Used as a pointer to a source in stream operations.
   8, (DI) Destination Index register. Used as a pointer to a destination in stream operations.

   Address  Name                      Description
   EAX*     Accumulator Register      calculations for operations and results data
   EBX      Base Register             pointer to data in the DS segment
   ECX*     Count Register            counter for string and loop operations
   EDX*     Data Register             input/output pointer
   ESI      Source Index              source pointer for string operations
   EDI      Destination Index         destination pointer for string operations
   ESP      Stack Pointer             stack pointer, should not be used
   EBP      Base Pointer              pointer to data on the stack

(AX) => (CX) => (DX) => (BX) => (SP) => (BP) => (SI) => (DI): Same order that is used in a push-to-stack operation
"R" = Register
"E" = Extended
A(C|D|B)X also be addressed as A(C|D|B)H & A(C|D|B)L

                             Segment Registers
Segment Registers <=> Segmented Memory Registers
 The 6 Segment Registers are:
   1, (SS) Stack Segment.  Pointer to the stack.
   2, (CS) Code Segment.   Pointer to the code.     <=> Starting Address of .text section
   3, (DS) Data Segment.   Pointer to the data.     <=> Starting Address of .data & .bss section
   4, (ES) Extra Segment.  Pointer to extra data ('E' stands for 'Extra').
   5, (FS) F Segment.      Pointer to more extra data ('F' comes after 'E').
   6, (GS) G Segment.      Pointer to still more extra data ('G' comes after 'F').

   Address          Name            Description
   CS               Code Segment    where instructions being executed are stored
   DS, ES, FS, GS   Data Segment    data segment
   SS               Stack Segment   where the stack for the current program is stored

   Most applications on most modern operating systems (like FreeBSD, Linux or Microsoft Windows)
use a memory model that points nearly all segment registers to the same place (and uses paging instead), effectively disabling their use.
  Typically the use of FS or GS is an exception to this rule, instead being used to point at thread-specific data.

                             Pointer Registers
The pointer registers are 32-bit EIP, ESP, and EBP registers and corresponding 16-bit right portions IP, SP, and BP. There are three categories of pointer registers −
    1, (R|EIP) Instruction Pointer  − The 16-bit IP register stores the offset address of the next instruction to be executed.
    IP in association with the CS register (as CS:IP) gives the complete address of the current instruction in the code segment.
    => Code Segment + Instruction Pointer = Exact Address of current instruction in Code Segment.
    2, (R|ESP) Stack Pointer        − The 16-bit SP register provides the offset value within the program stack.
    SP in association with the SS register (SS:SP) refers to be current position of data or address within the program stack.
    => Stack Segment + Stack Pointer      = Exact Address of current position of data within the program Stack.
    3, (R|EBP) Base Pointer         − The 16-bit BP register mainly helps in referencing the parameter variables passed to a subroutine.
    The address in SS register is combined with the offset in BP to get the location of the parameter.
    BP can also be combined with DI and SI as base register for special addressing.
