Win32 API cheatsheet

Switching between Unix and Windows is hard... especially when your a lifelong Unix guy.
I forget the Windows API calls about 5 minutes after I learn them...
So here's a cheat sheet of useful API calls, much of this data is pulled from the book "Windows System Programming, Fourth Edition".
It a good read if your new (or don't often use) Windows.

Strings - "This string" (ASCII 8 bit)
Strings - L"This string" (Unicode 16 bit)

_tmain() -> goes to main() or wmain() depending on [_]UNICODE defines
